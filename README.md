# [WIP] BASIC KALAHA WEB CLIENT [WIP]

known issues:

- user manually clearing localstorage can lead to ghost lobby
- add passwords to game creation?
- weird refreshing on server shutdown
- fix weird bugs (with interval probably)

potential fixes:

- add creation timer for games and clear games after some time?
- add timer for player since moving and clear players from games
  that are not moving for a long time?
